- Housing Edit Mode  
    Feb 24, 2026  
    * Added a quick bar built into the addon  
      now you can access your items while in the  
      housing edit mode.  
    * Added lots of options for copy/drag/batch copy  
      delete etc into the edit mode as well  
    * Addon conflict dialog shows up the moment you open the  
      housing editor if another addon is already handling editing  
      features. So if you wish to disable mine you can. Also options  
      menu so you can turn it back on if you want and keybind mode
