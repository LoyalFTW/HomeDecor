* List Mode overhaul - faction icons now show
inline next to item names, collection checkmark
moved to top of icon and made smaller so it
stays out of the way.

* Fixed the Whats New popup and Professions Tip
popup so they only ever show once across all
your characters, not every time you log in or
swap alts.

* Added Hide PvP Items filter with tooltip so
you can browse Achievements and Vendors without
PvP rewards cluttering the list.
