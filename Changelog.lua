* Hide Completed Vendors on the World Map button
  now also hides the zone and continent badges
  when all vendors in that area are completed.
  Toggling the setting updates the map instantly
  without needing to close and reopen it.
  
* * Update to how the minimap reacts to the game hopefully fixes some bugs
  * Updated how events act with the minimap as well.

* Added Favorites / Saved List to the tracker, 
 the tracker itself now has two buttons you can view
 the tracker or see specifically your Saved List or 
 Favorites or Wishlist whatever you wanna call it 
 and collect a lot easier

* Map pin tooltip position is now its own setting
  separate from the rest of the addon - changing
  it won't touch tooltips anywhere else. Works
  the same across both the World Map and Minimap.
  Added a Middle option that locks the tooltip
  to the center of your screen instead of
  following the cursor. Button order in the
  World Map panel fixed to Left Right instead
  of Right Left.
  
* DecorAH filter results are now cached and only
  rebuild when something actually changes instead
  of recalculating the full list on every scroll
  or interaction. Recipe lookups are cached the
  same way. Noticeable on larger profession lists.
  
* Item data for profession recipes now preloads
  in small batches shortly after login so prices
  and tooltips are ready before you open the
  window instead of loading on demand.
  
 * List Mode overhaul - faction icons now show
 inline next to item names, collection checkmark
 moved to top of icon and made smaller so it
 stays out of the way.

 * Fixed the Whats New popup and Professions Tip
 popup so they only ever show once across all
 your characters, not every time you log in or
 swap alts.

 * Added Hide PvP Items filter with tooltip so
 you can browse Achievements and Vendors without
 PvP rewards cluttering the list.
