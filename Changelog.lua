* Added compact mode to the lumber tracker
also fixed a bug I found where if you put things
in the bank or mailed to a alt it wasn't tracking right
any more.

* Added so you can have your favorites / Wish list 
blink when you enter a area when using the tracker
this is in the options menu or the tracker settings

Sorry about the delay in updates guys I'm working on
something bigger and just cant release it yet.
