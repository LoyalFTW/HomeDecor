#HomeDecor

Feb 6, 2026

* Items that are dyable now say Dyable on them
you can also type Dye or Dyable in search

* reputations have been added, all reps are there
the ones that say reputation required are actually 
renown required, just haven't found a good fix for them yet
sorry... 

Currency is added just doesn't show at the moment
some things require more then 1 currency and makes the UI
look bad, I will continue to work on this.

* New UI for Icons has been added, this will let you know if
a quest or ach or rep is required, it will go green with a check
if you have already done it. (At the moment this is character specific)
I will make it for alts soon just been busy!

Let me know how you guys like it
ypu can comment on curse or on my Discord

* New Database has been added to save lag
things should run more smooth!
