Feb 17, 2026

* Added away to turn off counter/ check marks on vendors
just go to the options or right click minimap for the options 
under vendor 

* Added compact mode to the lumber tracker
also fixed a bug I found where if you put things
in the bank or mailed to a alt it wasn't tracking right
any more.
