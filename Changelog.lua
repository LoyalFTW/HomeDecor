#HomeDecor

Jan 31, 2026
* Added a DecorTracker, this will automatically 
detect the vendors in the area, it can be transparent
 like the quest list. Let me know if you enjoy it. 
 Feed back is welcome on the disc!
 
* Added Events Tab, this will blink 
first time you see it, after you click it
it will stay glowing until the event is over. 
Then go grey.

* Added Tooltip to let you know what's missing from the
 vendor by just hovering your mouse over it, holding 
 shift will tell you the names

* Search bar now lets you type 
"Vender", "Achievement", "Quests", "Rep or Reputation", or 
anything really and it should show you the right stuff. 
Let me know how that goes as well I tested it but lots 
of stuff was going on. 

* Proper Reputation tracking has been added. 

* Added a lot of media files to try and make the UI prettier 
might change this not sure hopefully you guys like it.
